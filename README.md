# Feedback_control_design
This is the design of a feedback controller, realized for the 'Automatic Control' course at Politecnico di Torino, using MATLAB.
So this repository contains:
- The trace/report of the problem "Problem_03_new_pdf"
- The MATLAB script file "Problem_03_02.m"
- The two functions: "nyquist1.m" and "myngridst.m"
